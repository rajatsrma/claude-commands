## How Commands Work

Claude Code custom commands are Markdown files with:
1. **YAML frontmatter** - Command metadata and configuration
2. **Command logic** - Bash scripts and analysis frameworks
3. **AI prompts** - Instructions for Claude's analysis

## Command Structure Example

```markdown
---
description: "Command description"
argument-hint: "<REQUIRED_ARG> e.g. /command 123" 
allowed-tools: ["Bash(*)"]

## Security Considerations

- All commands follow security-first principles
- Commands are read-only by default (no destructive operations)
- Sensitive data handling follows best practices
- Repository access permissions are respected

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Showing Up
- Ensure files are in `~/.claude/commands/` directory
- Check file permissions are readable
- Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
- Restart Claude Code session

### GitHub API Issues  
- Confirm `gh auth status` shows authenticated
- Check repository permissions for PR access
- Verify network connectivity to GitHub

### Tool Execution Errors
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed
- Check command argument format matches `argument-hint`
- Review command output for specific error messages
